php.mo 0.1 by Joss Crowcroft (http://www.josscrowcroft.com)
=====

Converts gettext translation '.po' files to binary '.mo' files in PHP.

**Usage:**

php.mo is a couple of functions that take an input (.po) file and generate an output (.mo) file. Usage is easy:

```php    
<?php
    require('php-mo.php');
    phpmo_convert( 'input.po', [ 'output.mo' ] );
?>
```

Just like that. You can even leave the second parameter blank, and the output file will take the same filename as the input file, with a .mo extension.

IÕve double-checked the phpmo-generated .mo binary files with those generated by Poedit, and they seem to be identical Ð which leads me to believe that this is production-ready.

**NB:**

* If no $output_file specified, output filename is same as $input_file (but .mo)
* Returns true/false for success/failure
* No warranty, but if it breaks, please let me know
